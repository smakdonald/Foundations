<div class="para">We have just remarked that the set <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> is countably infinite, and hence it is countable. Let <span class="process-math">\(Z_* = \Z \sm \{0\}\text{.}\)</span> It follows from Exercise 6.5.8 (1) that <span class="process-math">\(\Z_*\)</span> is also countable. By Theorem 6.6.10 we know that <span class="process-math">\(Z \times  \Z_*\)</span> is countable, and it follows from Theorem 6.6.8 that there is a surjective function <span class="process-math">\(g : \N \to  \Z \times  \Z_*\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(f : \Z \times  \Z_* \to  \Q\)</span> be defined by <span class="process-math">\(f ((m, n)) = mn\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\((m, n)\in  Z \times  \Z_*\text{.}\)</span> Given that <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> consists of all fractions, it is evident that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is surjective. By Lemma 4.4.4 (2) we see that <span class="process-math">\(f \circ  g\)</span> is a surjective function <span class="process-math">\(\N \to  \Q\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> is countable by Theorem 6.6.8. Because <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> is infinite, as previously remarked, it is therefore countably infinite.</div>
