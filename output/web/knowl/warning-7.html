</h3> <div class="para">Lemma 6.5.2 might lead the reader to think of <span class="process-math">\(\#\)</span> as an equivalence relation, but we need to proceed with caution here. If <span class="process-math">\(\#\)</span> were a relation, on what set would it be a relation? We might want to think of <span class="process-math">\(\#\)</span> as a relation on the set of all sets, because for any two sets <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> it must be the case that either <span class="process-math">\(A \# B\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(A \not \# B\text{.}\)</span> However, because of foundational problems such as Russell's Paradox, which was discussed in Section 3.5, we avoid things such as the set of all sets. Hence, although <span class="process-math">\(\#\)</span> satisfies the three properties of an equivalence relation, it is not technically a relation on a set at all. If, however, all sets of interest are subsets of a given set <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> then it is correct to say that <span class="process-math">\(\#\)</span> is an equivalence relation on <span class="process-math">\(\cP(X)\text{.}\)</span>
