<div class="para">Whereas the most common logical form of the statement of a theorem is <span class="process-math">\(P \to  Q\text{,}\)</span> as we have discussed so far, another common form is <span class="process-math">\(P ↔ Q\text{.}\)</span> We refer to such theorems as “if and only if” theorems (often abbreviated “iff” theorems). To prove such a theorem, we make use of the fact that <span class="process-math">\(P ↔ Q\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="process-math">\((P \to  Q) \wedge  (Q \to  P)\text{,}\)</span> as was shown in Fact 1.3.2 (11). Hence, to prove a single statement of the form <span class="process-math">\(P ↔ Q\text{,}\)</span> it is sufficient to prove the two statements <span class="process-math">\(P \to  Q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q \to  P\text{,}\)</span> each of which can be proved using any of the methods we have seen so far.</div>
