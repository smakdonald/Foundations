<div class="para">By Zorn's Lemma (Theorem 3.5.6) the family of sets <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> has a maximal element. Let <span class="process-math">\(M\in  P\)</span> be such a maximal element. Then <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is an injective partial function from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> There are now three cases. First, suppose that for each <span class="process-math">\(a\in  A\text{,}\)</span> there is a pair of the form <span class="process-math">\((a, b) in M\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is an injective function <span class="process-math">\(A \to B\text{.}\)</span> Second, suppose that for each <span class="process-math">\(d\in B\text{,}\)</span> there is a pair of the form <span class="process-math">\((c, d)\in  M\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is a bijective partial function from <span class="process-math">\(A to B\text{,}\)</span> and using Exercise 4.4.13 (3) we see that the inverse function of <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> can be viewed as an injective function <span class="process-math">\(B \to  A\text{.}\)</span> Third, suppose that neither of the previous two cases holds. Then there is some <span class="process-math">\(x\in  A\)</span> such that there is no pair of the form <span class="process-math">\((x, b)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> and there is some <span class="process-math">\(y\in B\)</span> such that there is no pair of the form <span class="process-math">\((a, y)\in  M\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(N = M \cup\{(x, y)\}\text{.}\)</span> It is left to the reader to verify that <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is an injective partial function from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and hence that <span class="process-math">\(N\in  P\)</span> . Because <span class="process-math">\(M $ N\text{,}\)</span> we have a contradiction to the fact that <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is a maximal element of <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> and so this third case cannot happen.</div>
