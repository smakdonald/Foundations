<div class="para">â‡’. Suppose that m and n are not both odd. We will deduce that mn is not odd, and the desired result will follow by contrapositive. If m and n are not both odd, then at least one of them is even. Suppose first that m is even. Then there is an integer p such that m = 2p. Hence mn = (2p)n = 2(pn). Because p and n are integers, so is pn. Therefore mn is even. Next assume that n is even. The proof in this case is similar to the previous case, and we omit the details.</div>
