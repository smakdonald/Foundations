<div class="para">We follow [Bir48] and [LP98] in part. As a preliminary, we prove the following two facts: (1) <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup x = x\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\in  A\text{;}\)</span> and (2) <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup y = x\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcap y = y\text{,}\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x, y\in  A\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(x, y, z\in  A\text{.}\)</span> Using both parts of Property (c), we see that <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup x = x\sqcup (x\sqcap (x\sqcup x)) = x\text{,}\)</span> which proves Fact (1). Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup y = x\text{.}\)</span> Then by Properties (a) and (c) we see that <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcap y = (x\sqcup y)\sqcap y = y\sqcap (y\sqcup x) = y\text{,}\)</span> which proves one of the implications in Fact (2); a similar argument proves the other implication, and we omit the details.</div> <div class="para">We now show that <span class="process-math">\((A, \preccurlyeq)\)</span> is a poset. Because <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup x = x\)</span> by Fact (1), it follows from the definition of <span class="process-math">\(\preccurlyeq\)</span> that <span class="process-math">\(x\preccurlyeq x\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(\preccurlyeq\)</span> is reflexive. Now suppose that <span class="process-math">\(x\preccurlyeq y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\preccurlyeq z\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup y = x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\sqcup z = y\text{.}\)</span> By Property (b) we see that <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup z = (x\sqcup y)\sqcup z = x\sqcup (y\sqcup z) = x\sqcup y = x\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(x\preccurlyeq z\text{.}\)</span> Therefore <span class="process-math">\(\preccurlyeq\)</span> is transitive. Next, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(x\preccurlyeq y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\preccurlyeq x\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup y = x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\sqcup x = y\text{.}\)</span> It follows from Property (a) that <span class="process-math">\(x = y\text{.}\)</span> Therefore <span class="process-math">\(\preccurlyeq\)</span> is antisymmetric. We conclude that <span class="process-math">\((A, \preccurlyeq)\)</span> is a poset.</div> <div class="para">Finally, we show that <span class="process-math">\(\sqcup\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sqcap\)</span> are the meet and join of <span class="process-math">\((A, \preccurlyeq)\text{,}\)</span> respectively. It will then follow from this fact that meet and join always exist for any two elements of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\((A, \preccurlyeq)\)</span> is a lattice. We start with <span class="process-math">\(\sqcup\text{.}\)</span> Using Property (b) and Fact (1) we see that <span class="process-math">\((x\sqcup y)\sqcup y = x\sqcup (y\sqcup y) = x\sqcup y\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup y\preccurlyeq y\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup y = y\sqcup x\)</span> by Property (a), a similar argument shows that <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup y\preccurlyeq x\text{.}\)</span> Therefore <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup y\)</span> is a lower bound of <span class="process-math">\(\{x, y\}\text{.}\)</span> Now suppose that <span class="process-math">\(z\in A\)</span> is a lower bound of <span class="process-math">\(\{x, y\}\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(z\preccurlyeq x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\preccurlyeq y\text{,}\)</span> and therefore <span class="process-math">\(z\sqcup x = z\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\sqcup y = z\text{.}\)</span> By Property (b) we see that <span class="process-math">\(z\sqcup (x\sqcup y) = (z\sqcup x)\sqcup y = z\sqcup y = z\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(z\preccurlyeq (x\sqcup y)\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup y\)</span> is the greatest lower bound of <span class="process-math">\(\{x, y\}\text{,}\)</span> which means that <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup y\)</span> is the meet of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">We now turn to <span class="process-math">\(\sqcap\text{.}\)</span> By Property (c) we know that <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup (x\sqcap y) = x\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(x\preccurlyeq x\sqcap y\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcap y = y\sqcap x\)</span> by Property (a), a similar argument shows that <span class="process-math">\(y\preccurlyeq x\sqcap y\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcap y\)</span> is an upper bound of <span class="process-math">\(\{x, y\}\text{.}\)</span> Now suppose that <span class="process-math">\(w\in  A\)</span> is an upper bound of <span class="process-math">\(\{x, y\}\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(x\preccurlyeq w\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\preccurlyeq w\text{,}\)</span> and therefore <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcup w = x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\sqcup w = y\text{.}\)</span> By Fact (2) we deduce that <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcap w = w\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\sqcap w = w\text{.}\)</span> Property (b) then implies that <span class="process-math">\((x\sqcap y)\sqcap w = x\sqcap (y\sqcap w) = x\sqcap w = w\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\((x\sqcap y)\sqcup w = x\sqcap y\)</span> by Fact (2). Therefore <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcap y \preccurlyeq w\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcap y\)</span> is the least upper bound of <span class="process-math">\(\{x, y\}\text{,}\)</span> which means that <span class="process-math">\(x\sqcap y\)</span> is the join of <span class="process-math">\(x and y\text{.}\)</span>
