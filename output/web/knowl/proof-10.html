<div class="para">Let G = {n\in  N | 8n - 3n is divisible by 5}. We will use PMI to show that G = N, and it will then follow that 8n - 3n is divisible by 5 for all n\in  N, which is what we need to prove. First, we observe that G \subseteq  N by definition, and hence PMI is applicable. To use PMI, we need to show two things, which are that 1\in  G, and that if n\in  G then n + 1\in  G. We start with the first of these. Observe that 8^1 - 3^1 = 5, and therefore 8^1 - 3^1 is indeed divisible by 5. Hence 1\in  G, which is Part (a) of the statement of PMI.</div> <div class="para">To show Part (b) of the statement of PMI, let n\in  G. We then need to deduce that n + 1\in  G. Because n\in  G, we know that 8n - 3n is divisible by 5, which means that there is some k\in  Z such that 8n - 3n = 5k (recall the definition of divisibility in Section 2.2). To show that n+1\in  G will require showing that 8n+1 -3n+1 is divisible by 5; we can make use of our hypothesis that 8n - 3n is divisible by 5 in this proof. We compute 8n+1 - 3n+1 = 8 · 8n - 3 · 3n = (5 · 8n + 3 · 8n) - 3 · 3n = 5 · 8n + 3 · (8n - 3n) = 5 · 8n + 3(5k) = 5(8n + 3k). Because n and k are integers, then 8n + 3k is an integer, and hence 8n+1 - 3n+1 is divisible by 5. It follows that n + 1\in  G. We have therefore proved that Part (b) of the statement of PMI holds. PMI now implies that G = N, and the result is proved.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-induction.html#proof-10" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
