<div class="para">Theorems are not proved in a vacuum. To prove one theorem, we usually need to use various relevant definitions, and theorems that have already been proved. If we do not want to keep going backwards infinitely, we need to start with some objects that we use without definition, as well as some facts about these objects that are assumed without proof. Such facts are called axioms, and a body of knowledge that can be derived from a set of axioms is called an axiomatic system.</div>
