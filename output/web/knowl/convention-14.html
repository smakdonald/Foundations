</h4> <div class="para">Sometimes it is not possible to list all the elements of a set. In this case, it is sometimes convenient to use the so-called set builder notation in which the set is defined by stating a rule that all elements of the set must satisfy. If P .x/ is a predicate in the variable x, then the notation stands for the set of all elements x in the universal set U for which P .x/ is true. If it is clear what set is being used for the universal set, this notation is sometimes shortened to fx j P .x/g. This is usually read as “the set of all x such that P .x/.” The vertical bar stands for the phrase “such that.” Some writers will use a colon (:) instead of the vertical bar.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-set-basics.html#convention-14" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
