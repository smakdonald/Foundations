<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">Suppose to the contrary that <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> is countable. Because <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> is infinite, as already observed, it must be countably infinite. From Example 6.5.3 (4) we know that <span class="process-math">\((0, 1) \#  \R\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\((0, 1)\)</span> must be countably infinite. Let <span class="process-math">\(f : \N \to  (0, 1)\)</span> be a bijective function. For each <span class="process-math">\(n\in  \N\text{,}\)</span> we can write <span class="process-math">\(f (n)\)</span> as an infinite decimal f (n) = 0.a1 n a2 n a3 n \dots, where the numbers a1 n, a2 n, a3 n, \dots  are integers in {0, 1, \dots, 9}, and where the expansion does not eventually become the number 9 repeating.</div> <div class="para">For each k\in  N, let bk = { 1, if a k k \neq  1 2, if ak k = 1. Observe that bk \neq  ak k for all k\in  N. Let b be the number represented by the decimal expansion b = 0.b1 b2 b3 \dots . Because b k \neq  9 for all k\in  N, then this decimal expansion corresponds to a unique number in (0, 1). We claim that b \neq  f (n) for all n\in  N. The decimal expansion of any real number is unique if it does not become the number 9 repeating, and therefore if two numbers have different such decimal expansions (even if the difference is by only one digit) then the two numbers are not equal. For each n\in  N, the n-th digit in the decimal expansion of f (n) is a n n, whereas the n-th digit in the decimal expansion of b is b n. Hence b \neq  f (n) for all n\in  N. We have therefore reached a contradiction to the surjectivity of f, and we deduce that R is not countable.</div></article></body>
