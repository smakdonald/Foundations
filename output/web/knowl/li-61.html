<span class="process-math">\((\forall y)(∃x)L(x, y)\text{.}\)</span> This statement can be written as “for each type of fruit <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> there is a person <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> likes to eat <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span>” and more simply as “every type of fruit is liked by at least one person.” To verify whether this statement is true, we would have to list all the types of fruit, and then for each type of fruit, ask one person at a time whether she likes the fruit; once we found someone who liked that fruit, we could move onto the next fruit, and again ask one person at a time about it. For the statement to be true, we would have to find at least one person per fruit, though the same person could be selected for more than one fruit.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-quantifiers.html#li-61" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
