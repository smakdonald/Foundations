<span class="process-math">\((∃y)(\forall x)L(x, y)\text{.}\)</span> This statement can be written as “there is a type of fruit <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> such that for all persons <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> likes to eat <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span>” and more simply as “there is a type of fruit that all people like.” To verify whether this statement is true, we would have to list all the types of fruit, and then for one type of fruit at a time, ask each person in the world if she likes that type of fruit; as soon as we found one type of fruit that everyone likes, we would know that the statement is true, and we could stop asking about more types of fruit.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-quantifiers.html#li-62" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
