First, we show that <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is injective. Let <span class="process-math">\(x, y\in  [0, ∞)\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(k(x) = k(y)\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(x2 = y2\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(√x2 = √y2\text{,}\)</span> and because <span class="process-math">\(x ≥ 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y ≥ 0\text{,}\)</span> we deduce that <span class="process-math">\(x = √x2 = √y2 = y\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is injective. Second, we show that <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is surjective. Let <span class="process-math">\(b\in  [0, ∞)\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(√b\in  [0, ∞)\text{,}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(k(√b) = (√b)2 = b\text{.}\)</span> Hence k is surjective.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(g : [0, ∞) \to  R\)</span> be defined by <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = x2\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\in  [0, ∞)\text{.}\)</span> This function is injective but not surjective. The proof of the injectivity of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is the same as the proof of the injectivity of the function <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> in Part (1) of this example. The reason that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is not surjective is that <span class="process-math">\(g(a) \neq  -2\)</span> for any <span class="process-math">\(a\in  [0, ∞)\text{,}\)</span> though <span class="process-math">\(-2\)</span> is in the codomain of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span>

The proof of the surjectivity of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is the same as the proof of the surjectivity of the function <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> in Part (1) of this example. The reason <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is not injective is because <span class="process-math">\(h(-3) = 9 = h(3)\)</span> even though <span class="process-math">\(-3 \neq  3\text{.}\)</span> (Observe that instead of <span class="process-math">\(±3\)</span> we could have used <span class="process-math">\(±a\)</span> for any positive number <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> but a single instance where the definition of injectivity fails is sufficient.)</div></li>
