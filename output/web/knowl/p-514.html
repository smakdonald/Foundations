<div class="para">By Theorem 6.5.7 we know that <span class="process-math">\(\cP (\N) \not\sim  N\text{,}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(\cP (\N)\)</span> is not countably infinite. If we could show that <span class="process-math">\(\cP (\N)\)</span> were not finite, then it would follow that it is not countable. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(\cP (\N)\)</span> is finite. Let <span class="process-math">\(T = \{{n} | n\in  N\} \subseteq\cP (\N)\text{.}\)</span> It follows from Theorem 6.6.5 (1) that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is finite. However, it is evident that <span class="process-math">\(T \sim\N\text{,}\)</span> and this would imply that <span class="process-math">\(\N\)</span> is finite, which is a contradiction to Lemma 6.5.5 (1). We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\cP (\N)\)</span> is uncountable.</div>
