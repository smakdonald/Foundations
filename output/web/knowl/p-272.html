<div class="para">In the present chapter we will discuss the common basis for all systems of axioms used in contemporary mathematics, which is set theory. Though of surprisingly recent vintage, having been developed by Georg Cantor in the late nineteenth century, set theory has become widely accepted among mathematicians as the starting place for rigorous mathematics. We will take an intuitive approach to set theory (often referred to as “naive set theory”), but then build on it rigorously.</div>
