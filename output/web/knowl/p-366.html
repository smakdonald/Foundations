<div class="para">In principle, it would have been logical to have the chapter on relations before the chapter on functions, and to view functions as a special case of relations. In practice, however, most mathematicians do not think of functions as special types of relations when they use functions on a daily basis, and therefore functions deserve their own treatment independent of the study of relations.</div>
