<div class="para">Let G = {n\in  N | 8n - 3n is divisible by 5}. We will use PMI to show that G = N, and it will then follow that 8n - 3n is divisible by 5 for all n\in  N, which is what we need to prove. First, we observe that G \subseteq  N by definition, and hence PMI is applicable. To use PMI, we need to show two things, which are that 1\in  G, and that if n\in  G then n + 1\in  G. We start with the first of these. Observe that 8^1 - 3^1 = 5, and therefore 8^1 - 3^1 is indeed divisible by 5. Hence 1\in  G, which is Part (a) of the statement of PMI.</div>
