<span class="process-math">\((∃x)(∃y)L(x, y)\text{.}\)</span> This statement can be written as “there is a person <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> such that there is a type of fruit <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> likes to eat <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span>” and more simply as “there is a person who likes at least one type of fruit.” To verify whether this statement is true, we would have to start asking one person at a time if she likes some type of fruit; as soon as we found one person who answers yes, we would know that the statement is true, and we could stop asking more people.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-quantifiers.html#li-65" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
