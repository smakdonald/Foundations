<div class="para">The proof of Part (1) of Theorem 2.1.3 is quite simple, but there are a few features worth mentioning, because they are typical of what is found in virtually all our subsequent proofs (and in the proofs you will need to write). First, the proof relies completely on the definition of what it means to be an even or an odd integer. In a large number of proofs, going back to the formal definitions involved is the key step; forgetting to do so is a major source of error by students who are first learning about proofs.</div>
