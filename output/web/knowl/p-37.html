<div class="para">An example of a biconditional statement is “I will go for a walk if and only if Fred will join me.” This statement has the form <span class="process-math">\(P ↔ Q\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(P =\)</span> “I will go for a walk,” and <span class="process-math">\(Q =\)</span> “Fred will join me.” The truth of this statement does not say that I will go for a walk, or that Fred will join me. It says that either Fred will join me and I will go for a walk, or that neither of these things will happen. In other words, it could not be the case that Fred joins me and yet I do not go for a walk, and it also could not be the case that I go for a walk, and yet Fred has not joined me.</div>
