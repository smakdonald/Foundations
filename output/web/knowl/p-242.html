<div class="para">Because <span class="process-math">\(x^2 = 2\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\((\frac nm)^2 = 2\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(\frac{n^2}{m^2} = 2\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(n2 = 2m2\text{.}\)</span> We now ask whether <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even or odd. If <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> were odd, then using Exercise 2.2.4 we would see that <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> would be odd. This last statement is not possible, because <span class="process-math">\(n^2 = 2m^2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2m^2\)</span> must be even, because it is divisible by <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cannot be odd; hence <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> must be even. Therefore there is some integer <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(n = 2k\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\((2k)^2 = 2m^2\text{,}\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(4k^2 = 2m^2\text{,}\)</span> and therefore <span class="process-math">\(2k^2 = m^2\)</span> . By an argument similar to the one used above, we see that <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is even. We therefore conclude that both <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> are even. We have therefore reached a contradiction, because any two even numbers have <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> as a common factor, and yet we assumed that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> have no common factors other than <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is not rational.</div>
