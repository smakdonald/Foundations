<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(X \subseteq  A\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is finite, then by Theorem 6.6.5 (1) we know that <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is finite, and hence it is countable. Now assume that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is countably infinite. We will prove the theorem for the special case that <span class="process-math">\(A = \N\text{.}\)</span> For the general case, we observe that if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is countably infinite, then there is a bijective function <span class="process-math">\(f : A \to\N\text{,}\)</span> and the desired result follows from the fact that <span class="process-math">\(X \#  f (X)\text{,}\)</span> which holds by Exercise 6.5.4, and that <span class="process-math">\(f (X)\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(\N\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(A = \N\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is finite, then it is countable by definition, and there is nothing to prove. Now suppose that <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is infinite.</div> <div class="para">By the Well-Ordering Principle (Theorem 6.2.5), there is a unique element <span class="process-math">\(b\in  X\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(b \leq  x\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\in  X\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(k : G(X) \to  X\)</span> be defined as follows. Let <span class="process-math">\(g\in  G(X)\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(g\in  F (\{1, \dots, n\}, X)\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(n\in\N\text{,}\)</span> which means that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is a function <span class="process-math">\(\{1, \dots, n\} \to  X\text{.}\)</span> It follows from Exercise 6.6.3 that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> cannot be surjective, and hence <span class="process-math">\(X \sm g(\{1, \dots, n\}) \neq\es\)</span> . Using the Well-Ordering Principle again we see that there is a unique element <span class="process-math">\(z_g\in  X \sm g(\{1, \dots, n\})\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(z_g \leq  x\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\in  X \sm g(\{1, \dots, n\})\text{.}\)</span> We then let <span class="process-math">\(k(g) = z_g\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">We can apply Theorem 6.4.8 to <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> as above, and we deduce that there is a unique function <span class="process-math">\(f : \N \to  A\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f (1) = b\text{,}\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(f (n + 1) = k( f_|\{1,...,n\})\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(n\in\N\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(f (1) \leq  x\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\in  X\text{,}\)</span> and if <span class="process-math">\(n\in\N\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f (n + 1)\in  X \sm [ f |_{1,...,n}](\{1, \dots, n\}) = X \sm f (\{1, \dots, n\})\text{,}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(f (n + 1) \leq  y\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(y\in  X \sm f (\{1, \dots, n\})\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(r\in\N\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(f (r) \leq  y\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(y\in  X \sm f (\{1, \dots, r - 1\})\text{,}\)</span> where we think of <span class="process-math">\(\{1, \dots, 0\}\)</span> as the empty set when <span class="process-math">\(r = 1\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(f (r + 1)\in  X \sm f (\{1, \dots, \}) \subseteq  X - f (\{1, \dots, r - 1\})\text{,}\)</span> it follows that <span class="process-math">\(f (r) &lt; f (r + 1)\text{.}\)</span> By Exercise 6.3.4 we see that <span class="process-math">\(f (n) â‰¥ n\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(n\in\N\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">We now show that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is bijective. Let <span class="process-math">\(i, j\in\N\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(i \neq  j\text{.}\)</span> Without loss of generality assume that <span class="process-math">\(i &lt; j\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(i \leq  j - 1\text{,}\)</span> and also <span class="process-math">\(j &gt; 1\text{,}\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(j - 1\in\N\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(f (i)\in  f (\{1, \dots, j - 1\})\text{,}\)</span> and as observed above we know that <span class="process-math">\(f ( j)\in  X \sm f (\{1, \dots, j - 1\})\text{.}\)</span> Therefore <span class="process-math">\(f (i) \neq  f ( j)\text{,}\)</span> and we deduce that f is injective.</div> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(m\in  X\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(m \neq  f (p)\)</span> for any <span class="process-math">\(p\in\N\text{.}\)</span> Using a previous observation we know that <span class="process-math">\(m \leq  f(m)\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(m &lt; f(m)\text{.}\)</span> On the other hand, we saw above that <span class="process-math">\(f(m) \leq  y\)</span> for all<span class="process-math">\(y\in  X \sm f (\{1, \dots, m - 1\})\text{.}\)</span> By hypothesis on <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(m \not\in  f (\{1, \dots, m - 1\})\text{,}\)</span> and it follows that <span class="process-math">\(f(m) \leq  m\text{,}\)</span> which is a contradiction. Therefore <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is surjective.</div> <div class="para">We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is bijective, which implies that <span class="process-math">\(X \#\N\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is countably infinite, and therefore countable.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-finite-countable-sets.html#proof-22" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
