<div class="para">We will prove that all horses have the same color. More precisely, we will show that the statement “for any set of n horses, all the horses in the set have the same color,” is true for all n\in  N. Because there are only finitely many horses in the world, it will then follow that all existing horses have the same color. First, suppose that n = 1. It is certainly true that for any set of one horse, all the horses in the set have the same color. Next, suppose that the result is true for n, so that for any set of n horses, all the horses in the set have the same color. We need to show that the result is true for n + 1. Let {H1, \dots, Hn+1} be a set of n + 1 horses. The set {H1, \dots, Hn} has n horses, so by the inductive hypothesis all the horses in this set have the same color. On the other hand, the set {H2, \dots, Hn+1} also has n horses, so all horses in this set have the same color. In particular, it then follows that Hn and Hn+1 have the same color. Combining this fact with the previous observation that horses H1, \dots, Hn all have the same color, it follows that H1, \dots, Hn+1 all have the same color. We have therefore proved the inductive step. Hence all horses have the same color.</div>
