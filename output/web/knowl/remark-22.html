<div class="para">Observe that in the proof of Theorem 6.6.9 (2), we simultaneously had to choose a surjective function <span class="process-math">\(f_i : \N \to  A_i\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(i\in  I\text{;}\)</span> there really is a choice to be made, because there is more than one such function for each <span class="process-math">\(i\in  I\)</span> (except when <span class="process-math">\(A_i\)</span> has only one element in it). Hence, we are making use of the Axiom of Choice (Theorem 4.1.5). To use that axiom formally in this proof, we would let <span class="process-math">\(S_i\)</span> denote the set of all surjective functions <span class="process-math">\(N \to  A_i\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(i\in  I\text{,}\)</span> and we would apply the Axiom of Choice to the family of sets <span class="process-math">\(\{Si\}_{i\in I}\text{;}\)</span> we omit the details. It is pointed out in [Vau95, p. 56] that any proof of Theorem 6.6.9 (2) requires the Axiom of Choice.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-finite-countable-sets.html#remark-22" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
