<div class="para">We will prove the existence of maximal elements; the existence of minimal elements is similar, and we omit the details. Let <span class="process-math">\(n = |A|\text{.}\)</span> We proceed by induction on <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(n = 1\text{,}\)</span> then the single element of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is clearly a maximal element. Now assume that <span class="process-math">\(n \geq   2\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that the result is true for <span class="process-math">\(n - 1\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(w\in  A\text{,}\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(B = A - \{w\}\text{.}\)</span> By Exercise 7.4.8 we know that <span class="process-math">\((B, \preccurlyeq)\)</span> is a poset. Because |<span class="process-math">\(B| = n - 1\text{,}\)</span> it follows from the inductive hypothesis that there is a maximal element <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> We now define <span class="process-math">\(r\in  A\)</span> as follows. If <span class="process-math">\(p \preccurlyeq w\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(r = w\text{;}\)</span> if it is not the case that <span class="process-math">\(p \preccurlyeq w\text{,}\)</span> then let <span class="process-math">\(r = p\text{.}\)</span> We claim that <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is a maximal element of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> There are two cases. First, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(p \preccurlyeq w\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(r = w\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that there is some <span class="process-math">\(y\in  A\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(w \preccurlyeq y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(w \neq  y\text{.}\)</span> By transitivity it follows that <span class="process-math">\(p \preccurlyeq y\text{,}\)</span> and by antisymmetry it follows that <span class="process-math">\(p \neq y\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(y \neq  w\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(y\in B\text{,}\)</span> and we then have a contradiction to the fact that <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is a maximal element of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is a maximal element of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Second, suppose that it is not the case that <span class="process-math">\(p \preccurlyeq w\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(r = p\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is a maximal element of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> then there is no <span class="process-math">\(x\in B\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(p \preccurlyeq x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p \neq  x\text{.}\)</span> It follows that there is no <span class="process-math">\(x\in  A = B \cup\{w\}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(p \preccurlyeq x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p \neq  x\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is a maximal element of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>
