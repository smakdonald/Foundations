<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">We follow [KR83a]. We prove the result by induction on <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> When <span class="process-math">\(n = 1\)</span> the result is trivial. Now assume that <span class="process-math">\(n \geq 2\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that the result holds for <span class="process-math">\(n - 1\text{.}\)</span> By Theorem 7.4.9 the poset <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has a maximal element, say <span class="process-math">\(r\in  A\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(x\in  A\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(\preccurlyeq\)</span> is a total ordering, we know that <span class="process-math">\(x \preccurlyeq r\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(r \preccurlyeq x\text{.}\)</span> If it were the case that <span class="process-math">\(r \preccurlyeq x\text{,}\)</span> then by hypothesis on <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> we would know that <span class="process-math">\(r = x\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(x \preccurlyeq r\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(B = A \sm \{r\}\text{.}\)</span> By Exercise 7.4.8 we know that <span class="process-math">\((B, \preccurlyeq)\)</span> is a poset. Because <span class="process-math">\(|B| = n - 1\text{,}\)</span> it follows from the inductive hypothesis that there is an order isomorphism from <span class="process-math">\((B, \preccurlyeq)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((\{1, 2,\dots, n - 1\}, \leq )\text{,}\)</span> say <span class="process-math">\(f : B \to\{1, 2,\dots, n - 1\}\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(F : A \to\{1, 2,\dots, n\}\)</span> be defined by <span class="process-math">\(F(x) = f (x)\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\in B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F(r) = n\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is bijective, it is straightforward to see that <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is bijective as well; we omit the details. To see that <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is an order isomorphism, it suffices by Lemma 7.4.16 to show that <span class="process-math">\(x \preccurlyeq y\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(F(x) \leq  F(y)\text{,}\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x, y\in  A\text{.}\)</span> First, let <span class="process-math">\(x, y\in B\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(x \preccurlyeq y\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(f (x) \leq  f (y)\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is an order isomorphism. Because <span class="process-math">\(F(x) = f (x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F(y) = f (y)\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(x \preccurlyeq y\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(F(x) \leq  F(y)\text{.}\)</span> Now let <span class="process-math">\(z\in B\text{.}\)</span> We know that <span class="process-math">\(z \preccurlyeq r\text{,}\)</span> and we also know that <span class="process-math">\(F(z) \leq  n = F(r)\text{,}\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(F(z)\in\{1, 2,\dots, n - 1\}\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(z \preccurlyeq r\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(F(z) \leq  F(r)\text{,}\)</span> because both these statements are true. It follows that <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is an order isomorphism.</div></article></body>
