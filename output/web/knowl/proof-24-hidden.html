<li><div class="para">Choose some <span class="process-math">\(k\in  I\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(⋂i\in I Ai \subseteq  Ak\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(⋂i\in I Ai\)</span> is countable by Theorem 6.6.7.</div></li>

<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(A_i = \es\)</span>  for all <span class="process-math">\(i\in  I\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i = \es\text{,}\)</span> which implies that <span class="process-math">\(\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i\)</span> is finite, and hence countable. Now assume that <span class="process-math">\(Ak \neq\es\)</span>  for some <span class="process-math">\(k\in  I\text{.}\)</span> Because the empty set contributes nothing to a union of sets, the set <span class="process-math">\(\bigcup  i\in I Ai\)</span> will not be changed if we delete from <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> those elements <span class="process-math">\(s\in  I\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(A_s = \es\)</span> . Let us assume that that has been done, and therefore that <span class="process-math">\(A_i \neq\es\)</span>  for all <span class="process-math">\(i\in  I\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">There are two cases, depending upon whether <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is countably infinite or is finite. We prove the former case, leaving the other case to the reader in Exercise 6.6.12. Because we are assuming that <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is countably infinite, without loss of generality we may assume that <span class="process-math">\(I = \N\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Because <span class="process-math">\(A_i\)</span> is countable for all <span class="process-math">\(i\in  I\text{,}\)</span> then by Theorem 6.6.8 there is a surjective function <span class="process-math">\(f_i : N \to  A_i\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(i\in  I\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(g : \N \to  \bigcup_{i\in I} A_i\)</span> be defined as follows. Let <span class="process-math">\(r\in  \N\text{.}\)</span> We can apply Exercise 6.3.14 to the function <span class="process-math">\(f : \N \to  \N\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(f (n) = (n-1)n^2\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(n\in \ N\text{,}\)</span> and we deduce that there are unique <span class="process-math">\(n, p\in  \N\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\((n-1)n^2 &lt; r \leq n(n+1)^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r = (n-1)n^2 + p\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(g(r) = f n-p+1(p)\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(x\in \bigcup_{i\in I} A_i\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(x\in  A_k\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(k\in I\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(f_k\)</span> is surjective, there is some <span class="process-math">\(w\in  \N\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x = f_k(w)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(t = k + w - 1\text{.}\)</span> The reader can then verify that <span class="process-math">\(g( (t-1)t 2 + w) = f t-w+1(w) = f k(w) = x\text{.}\)</span> Therefore <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is surjective, and it follows from Theorem 6.6.8 that <span class="process-math">\(\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i\)</span> is countable.</div>
