<div class="para">We give two proofs, because both are instructive. First, we have a direct proof. To show that <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset \subseteq  A\text{,}\)</span> we need to show that if <span class="process-math">\(a\in\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(a\in  A\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(a\in\emptyset\)</span> is always false, then the logical implication “if <span class="process-math">\(a\in\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(a\in  A\)</span>” is always true, using the precise definition of the conditional given in Section 1.2.</div>
<div class="para">Next, we have a proof by contradiction. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset not\subseteq A\text{.}\)</span> Then there exists some <span class="process-math">\(x\in\emptyset\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x /\in  A\text{.}\)</span> This statement cannot be true, however, because there is no <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x\in\emptyset\text{.}\)</span> We have therefore reached a contradiction, and hence the desired result is true.</div>
<div class="para">This proof by contradiction might not appear to fit the standard outline for such proofs as described in Section 2.3, because it does not appear as if we are viewing the statement being proved as having the form <span class="process-math">\(P \to  Q\text{.}\)</span> In fact, there are two ways of viewing the statement being proved as having this form. For the direct proof given above, we viewed the statement being proved as <span class="process-math">\((\forall A)([a\in\emptyset] \to  [a\in  A])\text{.}\)</span> We then chose an arbitrary set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and proved the statement <span class="process-math">\([a\in\emptyset] \to  [a\in  A]\text{.}\)</span> For the proof by contradiction, we viewed the statement being proved as “if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a set, then <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset \subseteq  A\text{,}\)</span>” and then indeed used our standard method of doing proof by contradiction.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-set-basics.html#li-85" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
