<div class="para">When constructing a proof, the first thing to do is specify what you are assuming, and what it is you are trying to prove. Then you pick a strategy for the proof; one such strategy is direct proof. The next stage is actually figuring out a proof, making use of your chosen strategy. If you cannot devise a proof using your chosen strategy, perhaps another strategy should be attempted. There is no fixed way of finding a proof; it requires experimentation, playing around and trying different things.</div>
