<div class="para">To save time and effort, it is possible to write a smaller truth table with the same information as the truth table above, by writing one column at a time, and labeling the columns in the order of how we write them. In the truth table shown below, we first write columns 1 and 2, which are just copies of the P and Q columns; we then write column 3, which is the negation of the R column; column 4 is formed from columns 2 and 3, and column 5 is formed from columns 1 and 4. We put the label “5” in a box, to highlight that its column is the final result of the truth table, and refers to the compound statement in which we are interested. It is, however, the same result as in the previous truth table.</div>
