<div class="para">In the proof of Theorem 2.4.1 we had two cases, which together covered all possibilities, and which were exclusive of each other. It is certainly possible to have more than two cases, and it is also possible to have non-exclusive cases; all that is needed is that all the cases combined cover all possibilities. The proof of Theorem 2.4.4 below has two non-exclusive cases.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="other-structures.html#remark-15" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
