<div class="para">⇒. Suppose that a|b and b|a. Because a|b, there is some integer m such that am = b, and because b|a, there is some integer k such that bk = a. Substituting this last equation into the previous one, we obtain (bk)m = b, and hence b(km) = b. Because b 6 = 0, it follows that km = 1. Because k and m are integers, then either k = 1 and m = 1, or k = −1 and m = −1. (We will not provide a proof of this last fact; it is stated as Theorem A.4 in the Appendix.) In the former case a = b, and in the latter case a = −b.</div> <div class="para">⇐. Suppose that a = b or a = −b. First, suppose that a = b. Then a · 1 = b, so a|b, and b · 1 = a, so b|a. Similarly, suppose that a = −b. Then a · (−1) = b, so a|b, and b · (−1) = a, so b|a.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="other-structures.html#proof-8" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
