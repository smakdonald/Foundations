<div class="para">We prove the result by contradiction. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> are non-negative consecutive integers other than <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5\text{,}\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{.}\)</span> Because a, b and c are not 3, 4 and 5, we know that a \neq  3, and because the three numbers are consecutive, we know that b = a + 1 and c = a + 2. From <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\)</span> we deduce that <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + (a + 1)^2 = (a + 2)^2\text{.}\)</span> After expanding and rearranging we obtain <span class="process-math">\(a^2 - 2a - 3 = 0\text{.}\)</span> This equation factors as <span class="process-math">\((a - 3)(a + 1) = 0\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(a = 3 or a = -1\text{.}\)</span> We have already remarked that <span class="process-math">\(a \neq  3\text{,}\)</span> and we know a is non-negative. Therefore we have a contradiction, and the theorem is proved.</div>
