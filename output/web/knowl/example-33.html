</h3> <div class="para">The integers modulo <span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> is the set <span class="process-math">\(\Z/12 = \{[0], [1], \dots, [11]\}\text{.}\)</span> This set has <span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> elements, each of which is itself a set (namely, a relation class), but which is viewed here as a single element in the set <span class="process-math">\(\Z/12\text{.}\)</span> The relation classes in <span class="process-math">\(\Z/12\)</span> could each be described differently. For example, we see that <span class="process-math">\([0] = [12]\text{,}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(\Z/12 = \{[12], [1], \dots, [11]\}\text{,}\)</span> which is what we see on the face of a clock. For mathematical purposes it is more convenient to write <span class="process-math">\([0]\)</span> rather than <span class="process-math">\([12]\text{,}\)</span> and so we will continue to write <span class="process-math">\(\Z/12\)</span> as we did originally; it would also be nice to have the <span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> on clocks replaced with <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> but historical practice holds sway over mathematics in this situation. There are, of course, many other ways to rewrite the elements of <span class="process-math">\(\Z/12\text{,}\)</span> for example <span class="process-math">\(\Z/12 = \{[-36], [25], [-10], \dots, [131]\}\text{,}\)</span> and so it would in principle be possible to replace the number on a clock with <span class="process-math">\(-36, 25, -10, \dots, 131\text{,}\)</span> though presumably only mathematicians would find that amusing.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-congruence.html#example-33" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
