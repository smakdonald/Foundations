<div class="para">One final comment on writing proofs: neither thinking up proofs nor writing them properly is easy, especially as the material under consideration becomes more and more abstract. Mathematics is not a speed activity, and you should not expect to construct proofs rapidly. You will often need to do scratch work first, before writing up the actual proof. As part of the scratch work, it is very important to figure out the overall strategy for the problem being solved, prior to looking at the details. What type of proof is to be used? What definitions are involved? Not every choice of strategy ultimately works, of course, and so any approach needs to be understood as only one possible way to attempt to prove the theorem. If one approach fails, try another. Every mathematician has, in some situations, had to try many approaches to proving a theorem before finding one that works; the same is true for students of mathematics.</div>
