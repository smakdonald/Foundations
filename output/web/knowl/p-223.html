<div class="para">In this section we discuss two strategies for proving statements of the form <span class="process-math">\(P \to  Q\text{.}\)</span> Both these strategies are a bit more convoluted than direct proof, but in some situations they are nonetheless easier to work with. A less than perfect analogy might be when the straightest road between two cities leads up and down a mountain and through difficult terrain, whereas a curved road might at first seem to be going in the wrong direction, but in fact it bypasses the mountain and is ultimately easier and quicker than the straight road.</div>
