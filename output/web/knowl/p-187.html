<div class="para">The main reason, of course, is to be sure that something is true. Contrary to popular misconception, mathematics is not a formal game in which we derive theorems from arbitrarily chosen axioms. Rather, we discuss various types of mathematical objects, some geometric (for example, circles), some algebraic (for example,polynomials), some analytic (for example, derivatives) and the like. To understand these objects fully, we need to use both intuition and rigor. Our intuition tells us what is important, what we think might be true, what to try next and so forth. Unfortunately, mathematical objects are often so complicated or abstract that our intuition at times fails, even for the most experienced mathematicians. We use rigorous proofs to verify that a given statement that appears intuitively true is indeed true.</div>
