<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is finite, then by Theorem 6.6.5 (1) we know that <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is finite, and hence it is countable. Now assume that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is countably infinite. We will prove the theorem for the special case that <span class="process-math">\(A = \N\text{.}\)</span> For the general case, we observe that if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is countably infinite, then there is a bijective function <span class="process-math">\(f : A \to\N\text{,}\)</span> and the desired result follows from the fact that <span class="process-math">\(X \#  f (X)\text{,}\)</span> which holds by Exercise 6.5.4, and that <span class="process-math">\(f (X)\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(\N\text{.}\)</span>
