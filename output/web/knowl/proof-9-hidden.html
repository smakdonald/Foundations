<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">⇐. Suppose that m and n are both odd. Hence there is an integer j such that m = 2 j + 1, and there is an integer k such that n = 2k + 1. Therefore mn = (2 j + 1)(2k + 1) = 4 jk + 2 j + 2k + 1 = 2(2 jk + j + k) + 1. Because k and j are integers, so is 2 jk + j + k. Therefore mn is odd.</div> <div class="para">⇒. Suppose that m and n are not both odd. We will deduce that mn is not odd, and the desired result will follow by contrapositive. If m and n are not both odd, then at least one of them is even. Suppose first that m is even. Then there is an integer p such that m = 2p. Hence mn = (2p)n = 2(pn). Because p and n are integers, so is pn. Therefore mn is even. Next assume that n is even. The proof in this case is similar to the previous case, and we omit the details.</div></article></body>
