<div class="para">In the previous sections of this chapter we looked at statements from the point of view of truth and falsity. We verified the truth or falsity of statements via truth tables, which allowed us to consider all possible ways in which various component statements might be true or false. This approach, while the most basic way to treat the truth or falsity of statements, does not appear to resemble the way mathematicians prove theorems, which is by starting with the hypotheses, and then writing one new statement at a time, each of which is implied by the previous statements, until the conclusion is reached. In this section we look at the analogous construction in logic, that is, the rules of logical argumentation, and we will see the relation of this approach to what was discussed in the previous sections of this chapter.</div>
