<div class="para">This proof by contradiction might not appear to fit the standard outline for such proofs as described in Section 2.3, because it does not appear as if we are viewing the statement being proved as having the form <span class="process-math">\(P \to  Q\text{.}\)</span> In fact, there are two ways of viewing the statement being proved as having this form. For the direct proof given above, we viewed the statement being proved as <span class="process-math">\((\forall A)([a\in\emptyset] \to  [a\in  A])\text{.}\)</span> We then chose an arbitrary set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and proved the statement <span class="process-math">\([a\in\emptyset] \to  [a\in  A]\text{.}\)</span> For the proof by contradiction, we viewed the statement being proved as “if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a set, then <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset \subseteq  A\text{,}\)</span>” and then indeed used our standard method of doing proof by contradiction.</div>
