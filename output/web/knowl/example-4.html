<div class="para">A simple example of a conditional statement is “if it rains today, then I will see a movie this evening.” This statement has the form <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(P =\)</span> “it rains today,” and <span class="process-math">\(Q =\)</span> “I will see a movie this evening.” The truth of this statement does not say that it is raining today, nor that I will see a movie this evening. It only says what will happen if it rains today, which is that I will see a movie this evening. If it does not rain, I still might see a movie this evening, or I might not; both of these possibilities would be consistent with the truth of the original statement “if it rains today, then I will see a movie this evening.”</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-statements.html#example-4" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
